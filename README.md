## üèÜ About

GlauTude is **your lightweight command line tool** for enjoying YouTube content directly from your terminal. Designed for efficiency and a distraction-free experience, GlauTude leverages powerful open source tools like yt-dlp and mpv (or ConPlayer on Windows) to deliver ad-free video and audio playback. It's ideal for quick media access and for those who prefer the speed and simplicity of the command line.
