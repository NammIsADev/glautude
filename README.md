## üèÜ About

GlauTude is **your lightweight command line tool** for enjoying YouTube content directly from your terminal. Designed for efficiency and a distraction-free experience, GlauTude leverages powerful open source tools like yt-dlp and mpv (or ConPlayer on Windows) to deliver ad-free video and audio playback. It's ideal for quick media access and for those who prefer the speed and simplicity of the command line.

> [!WARNING]
> *Linux:* For the best results with terminal pixel graphics, ~~**your terminal must support Sixel**~~ **atleast terminal support True Color** (e.g., foot, mlterm, Kitty, etc.).
>
> *Termux:* Playing video directly in the terminal can be resource-intensive, particularly on mobile devices (Termux). You might **experience slower rendering or desynchronization** compared to dedicated video players. For optimal performance, consider playing audio-only or selecting lower video resolutions.
>
> *Windows:* For the best visual experience, it is **highly recommended to use Windows Terminal** from the Microsoft Store.

## üíæ How to use
GlauTude is designed for easy setup and interactive use. Follow these steps to get started on your preferred platform:

### Download the Script
For Windows: 
```batch
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NammIsADev/glautude/main/windows/windows.cmd -o windows.cmd
windows.cmd
```
For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian or any apt-based distro):
```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NammIsADev/glautude/main/linux/linux.sh -o linux.sh && chmod +x linux.sh && ./linux.sh
```
For Termux (Android): 
```bash
termux-setup-storage && curl -LJO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NammIsADev/glautude/main/termux-experimental/termux.sh && chmod +x termux.sh && ./termux.sh
```

### Place the Script
It's highly recommended to place the downloaded script in a dedicated, easy-to-access folder (e.g., `Desktop` on Windows, or ~`/GlauTude/` on Linux/Termux). Avoid running the script directly from your temporary system folder (`%TEMP%` on Windows, or `/tmp/` on Linux/Termux)

### Run GlauTude
The first time you run GlauTude, it will automatically detect and install all necessary dependencies (like yt-dlp, mpv/ConPlayer, ffmpeg, jq, etc.) into a `bin` subfolder within the script's directory. This process requires an active internet connection and may take a few moments.

### Interactive Menu
Once launched, GlauTude will present you with an interactive command-line menu:

```
-------------------------------------------------------------------
            GLAUTUDE - Powered by <player> and yt-dlp
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: ...

[1] Play video/audio by YouTube URL
[2] Search YouTube Video
[3] Clear Temp (recommended before playback)
[4] Exit

Select an option [1-4]:
```
Option:
- Play video/audio by YouTube URL: Enter a full YouTube URL when prompted. You can then choose audio-only playback or select a specific video quality from the listed formats.
- Search YouTube Video: Enter your search terms, and GlauTude will display a list of top results. Select the number corresponding to the video you wish to play, with options for quality or audio-only.
- Clear Temp: This option helps manage disk space by removing temporary files created during playback. It's recommended to run this periodically.
- Exit: Closes the GlauTude application.

|Space| Pause / Resume playback|
|q| Quit playback              |
